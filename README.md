# Comparative Analysis of Edge Detection Using Different Parallel Computing Techniques

## What is this

Using OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA to implement edge detection in C++. Analyze their results and performance.

## Building

### Library Requirements

1. libpng
2. libomp
3. open-mpi
4. CUDA Toolkit

### Build Step

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Then the executabel file `main` is in current directory.
